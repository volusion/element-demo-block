# A demo block for Volusion's Element system.

## Getting Started

1. After cloning the repo, run `npm install` in the root directory of this repo to install dependencies that are shared by multiple blocks.

2. Navigate to the subdirectory for the block you want to work on, and follow the setup instructions in the README for that specific block. You will most likely need to run `npm install` a second time from each block directory.
